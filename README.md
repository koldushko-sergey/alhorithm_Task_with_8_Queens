# alhorithm_Task_with_8_Queens
We need to place 8 Queens on the chessboard so that no Queen attacks the other. In the simplest solution, we will have to go through 64 billion combinations and choose 8-4 billion possible combinations. It is also a good option to put each Queen in a separate column, which reduces the number of possibilities to 8⁸ — ~17 million. But it is best to put each Queen in a separate row and in a separate column. This will result in 8! — 40 thousand possible combinations. In the implementation below, we assume that each Queen occupies a separate column, and calculate the row number for each of the 8 Queens.
